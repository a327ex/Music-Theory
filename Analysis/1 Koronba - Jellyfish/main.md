### Bars 1-4

| Bar | Chords | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | GbM7 | VI7 |
| 2 | F7 | V7/i |
| 3 | Bbm7sus2 | i7sus2 |
| 4 | Db7 | V7/VI |

This initial section is in Bb minor, so the first chord is VI7. The second one is V7, but it's a dominant resolving to the tonic, so written as V7/i.
The next chord is the tonic with a suspended 2nd, Bbm7sus2 (i7sus2). It is sus2 because the progression forms a descending chromatic line on the high note, which would be ruined if it was simply Bbm7.
The final chord is Db7, which is not in Bb's harmonic field. The next chord is GbM7, so looking at Gb's harmonic field we can see that Db7 is the fifth chord,
which means Db7 is acting as a secondary dominant chord, thus written as V7/VI, or, the dominant in Gb major that resolves to the 6th chord in Bb minor.

These descending chromatic lines that Koronba does often have at least one note that is the same linking any two chords, this grounds the progression better than if it was always a complete change.

### Bars 5-8

| Bar | Chords | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | GbM7 | VIM7 |
| 6 | F7 | V7/i |
| 7 | Bbm, Gbm7, Fm7, Ab/Bb | i, vi7?, v7, VII/i |
| 8 | Em7, Am7, D, D7 | vi7, ii7, V, V7 |

The first two chords are the same as in the previous bars, and then we have a sequence of a lot of chords in the next two bars.
In bar 7 we have a chromatic walk down, still in Bb minor. Bbm is the tonic, so i.
Gbm7 is not in Bb's harmonic field, and I don't quite remember the logic of where it comes from.
The next chord is Fm7, which is in Bb minor's harmonic field. It could be that Gbm7 is there as it is a chromatic passage chord between Bbm and Fm7, as it is fully chromatic with regards to Fm7.
And then it ends with Ab/Bb, which also is in Bb minor's harmonic field and thus would be written as VII/i I believe.

In bar 8 we shift from Bb minor to G major, which was chosen likely because the target we want to go to is B minor, and G major is B minor's indirect neighbor.
The first chord is Em7 (vi7), the second Am7 (ii7), and the third is D (V). Nothing of note about those three, but the final one is D7 (V7), which resolves to GM7 in the next bar.
In the key of G major, this is a simple dominant to tonic resolution, and should thus be written as V7/i. But in the next bar GM7 is not really G's first chord, but as B's 6th,
so maybe writing it as just V7 is more correct?

### Bars 9-12

| Bar | Chords | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | GM7, F#7 | VIM7, V7/i |
| 10 | Bm7, G#m7b5 | i7, vim7b5 (dorian) |
| 11 | Em7, A7 | iv7, VII7 |
| 12 | DM7, Bm7 | IIIM7, i7 |

All chords here are in B minor's harmonic field, with the exception of G#m7b5, which is borrowed from the B's Dorian mode.
F#7 acts as a dominant that resolves to the tonic (Bm7), thus it is written as V7/i. More generally, on the first 3 bars there's a pattern where we have a stable and then an unstable chord.
GM7 is stable because it is a 6th chord (tonic), F#7 is unstable because it is a 5th chord (dominant).
Bm7 is stable because it is the tonic, G#m7b5 is unstable because it is diminished.
Em7 is stable because it is a 3rd chord (tonic), A7 is unstable because it is a 7th chord (dominant). 
It's also worth noting that on bars 9 and 11, each unstable chord resolves to the next stable chord. F#7 (V in B) resolves to Bm7 (i in B), A7 (V in D) resolves to DM7 (I in D)

This play on stability and instability creates a sense of moving the song forward. If you would imagine the melody as a story being told, as long as these chords are alternating like this,
the story can be told in an interesting way that keeps the listener paying attention. Only when this pattern is broken in bar 12 do we get a break from this sentence in the story (and start the next).

### Bars 13-16

| Bar | Chords | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | GM7, F#7 | VI7, V7/i |
| 14 | F#m7, F7, EM7, C#m/E | v7, bV7, IVM7, ii/IV? |
| 15 | D#m7b5, G#7 | iim7b5, V7/i |
| 16 | C#m7, Cm7, Bm7, E/A#, C#m7 | |

The first two chords are the same as in the previous bars, and then we have a sequence of a lot of chords in bar 14.
We start from F#7 in bar 13, and end in C#m/E in bar 14, going through a chromatic walk down in between.
From F#7 to F#m7 we keep all notes the same except A, and also F#m7 (v7) is in B minor's harmonic field.

Next we go from F#m7 to F7, which is not in B's harmonic field.
The logic of where it comes from looks at the next chord, EM7, and notes that F7 is a tritone substitution of B7, which would be EM7's dominant chord.
B7 (B, D#, F#, A) has a D# + A tritone, which is kept, and then we raise EM7's base note (E) by a semitone, to get F + D# + A.
And then we need this to be a dominant chord with a minor seventh, so we get F + A + C + D#, which is F7.
F7 is written as bV7 because F#7 is in B's harmonic field, and so we want to point to the fact that it is a semitone lower.

Next we have EM7, which is the 4th chord in B's ionian mode. It's common for songs to borrow chords freely between their major and minor modes, and this is an instance of that.
EM7 would thus be written as IVM7. And finally we get to C#m/E, which is in B's harmonic field, but it is also borrowed from the Ionian mode, and I believe it should be written as ii/IV?

In bar 15 we have two unstable/tense chords, as this bar is the preparation for the final chromatic walk down that ends this verse entirely.
This also marks a key shift from B minor to C# minor, as both the chords and the melody start making more sense if analyzed from that key.
The first chord, D#m7b5, is in C# minor's harmonic field, and thus would be written as iim7b5.
The second chord, G#7, is also in C# minor's harmonic field, and would thus be written as V7/i, because it acts as the dominant chord that resolves to the next one, C#m7.

And here starts the final chromatic walk down for the verse, that starts with C#m7~
